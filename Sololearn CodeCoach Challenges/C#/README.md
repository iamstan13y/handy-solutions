# 1. Password Validation

You're interviewing to join a security team. They want to see you build a password evaluator for your technical interview to validate the input.

### :bookmark_tabs: Task: 
Write a program that takes in a string as input and evaluates it as a valid password. The password is valid if it has at **a minimum 2 numbers, 2 of the following special characters ('!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '&', '*'), and a length of at least 7 characters.**
If the password passes the check, output **'Strong'**, else output **'Weak'**.

**Input Format:** <br/>
_A string representing the password to evaluate._

**Output Format:** <br/>
_A string that says 'Strong' if the input meets the requirements, or 'Weak', if not._

_Hello@$World19_

**Sample Output:** <br/>
_Strong_
